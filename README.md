KrISS MVVM
==========
A simple and smart (or stupid) MVVM framework

WIPOC project (Work In Progress and Proof Of Concept)

Presentation
------------
The goal is to build a really flexible MVVM framework that let you
build very rapidly a skeleton for apps. Look at the mini.php file and
you will see how it's easy to have a very simple CRUD app for Test
class.

To illustrate the flexibility, KrISS MVVM already works with different projects :
* [Dice](https://github.com/level-2/dice) for the container
* [Transphporm](https://github.com/level-2/maphper) for the template (temporary removed)
* [Maphper](https://github.com/level-2/maphper) for the model
* [HybridLogicValidation](https://github.com/Dachande663/PHP-Validation) for the validation

Installation
------------
```bash
cd /var/www/html #it's up to you
git clone https://github.com/kriss/mvvm
```
you can go to your mvvm directory with a browser and the demo should work.
